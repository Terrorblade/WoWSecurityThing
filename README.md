# WoWSecurityThing
A small application for changing dbc ext's to .xxx instead of .dbc for minor patch protection with the convient option of running FukITUP on an MPQ at the same time. This small program is based on stoneharry's work from like 10 years ago, I just minorly edited it and put it in .netcore.
